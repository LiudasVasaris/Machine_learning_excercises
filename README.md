# Machine_learning_excercises
Excercises done in Python from course [Machine Learning by Anrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

As i am a fan of interactive graphs, most of them will be done using `Plotly` so they might not be observable looking straight through github
For this reason i will also be attaching `.html` files to maintain `Plotly` graph outputs with code that can be observed directly, without running the code itself

The directories also include solved solutions of the excercises using `Octave`. These solutions were solved by [stamatelou](https://github.com/stamatelou/Machine-Learning-AndrewNg-SOLUTIONS.git)
